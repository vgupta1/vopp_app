This visualization illustrates some key insights
from the paper [*The Value of Personalized Pricing*](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Vishal-Gupta/Papers/PersonalizedPricing.pdf), by Adam Elmachtoub, Vishal Gupta, and Michael Hamilton.

Many online retailers try to use your cookies and browser history to learn about you.  When you want to buy something, they use that information to charge you a custom, ``personalized"" price based on how much they think you're willing to pay. If they do it well, they could (theoretically) make more money.

 *But how much more??*

The answer is... it depends... The first plot shows the most a retailer could hope to make from personalized pricing relative to charging everyone the same price.  The is value depends on how **heterogeneous** the market, i.e., how differently do two people value the product?  The second plot shows (in this ideal setting) what percentage of the market would buy at each price.  

Both bounds depend on what the minimum, maximum and average amount people are willing to pay for the product, and market heterogeneity.  (See [paper](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Vishal-Gupta/Papers/PersonalizedPricing.pdf) for details.)
