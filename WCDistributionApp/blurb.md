This visualization illustrates some key insights
from the paper [*The Value of Personalized Pricing*](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Vishal-Gupta/Papers/PersonalizedPricing.pdf), by Adam Elmachtoub, Vishal Gupta, and Michael Hamilton.

Many online retailers try to use your cookies and browser history to learn about you.  When you want to buy something, they use that information to charge you a custom, ``personalized"" price based on how much they think you're willing to pay. If they do it well, they could (theoretically) make more money.

 *But how much more??*

The answer is... it depends... The first plot shows **the most** a retailer could hope to make from personalized pricing relative to charging everyone the same price.  This value depends on a measure of how **heterogeneous** the market is, i.e., *"How differently do two people value the product?"*  The second plot shows (in this ideal setting) what percentage of the market would have to buy at each price to achieve this value.  (See paper for details.)
