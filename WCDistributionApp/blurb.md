This visualization shows some key insights
from the paper [*The Value of Personalized Pricing*](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Vishal-Gupta/Papers/PersonalizedPricing.pdf), by Adam Elmachtoub, Vishal Gupta, and Michael Hamilton.

Many online retailers try to use your cookies and browser history to learn about you.  When you want to buy something, they can use that information to charge you a custom, personalized price based on how much they think you're willing to pay. If they do it well, they could (theoretically) make more money.

 *But how much more??*

The answer is... it depends... The left plot is upperbound on the most the retailer could hope to make from personalized pricing relative to charging everyone the same price based on the market's heterogeneity.  The right plot shows how people's opinions about product value should differ across the population to achieve that upperbound.  Both bounds depend on what the minimum, maximum and average amount people are willing to pay for the product, and roughly how much people's opinions differ about the product's worth.  (See [paper](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/Vishal-Gupta/Papers/PersonalizedPricing.pdf) for details.)
